# Finite difference method for the demagnetizing field calculation
Solves the  2D demagnetizing field "Hd" for a given magnetization configuration using the finite difference method.

One script runs Hd considering only the magnetic domain. The other considers the vaccum exterior as well.

## Method:
$\Nabla \phi$

### Potential of the magnetic field Hd, example:
